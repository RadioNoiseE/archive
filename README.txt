Status of This Document

   This document explains the repository which contains the source for
   my homepage.  Hopefully this will help those who want a less bloated
   personal site.  This document itself is licensed under the GNU Free
   Documentation License.


1.  About

   Here is the source of my homepage.  All pages are valid HTML5 and
   CSS3.  Most pages are written in RsML, while the rest are hand-
   written.

2.  Build

   You don't literally need to build this site, as this site is not
   generated by a so-called static website generator.

   In case you are curious how the HTMLs are transformed from XMLs, an
   XSL style-sheet will be applied on the source, with appropriate pre-
   processing stages if necessary.

   The math support is based on BlahTeX, which converts the TeX sources
   into MathML3.  It's not perfect, especially when handling spacing
   between operators, but it's the best choice if not counting those
   JavaScript implementations.

3.  Compatibility

   The HTML5 version should work for all browsers which are capable of
   rendering HTML5 and optionally CSS3.  The RsML version seems to work
   fine on Firefox 3.0 and newer and Safari 3.  Saxon and xsltproc
   (libxslt) can be used for applying style-sheet.
