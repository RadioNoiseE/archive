Status of This Document

   This document explains the repository which contains the source for
   my  homepage.  Hopefully  this  will  help those  who  want a  less
   bloated personal site.  This document  itself is licensed under the
   GNU Free Documentation License.


1.  About

   Here is the  source of my homepage.  All pages  are valid HTML5 and
   CSS3.  Most  pages are written  in RsML,  while the rest  are hand-
   written.

2.  Build

   You don't  literally need to build  this site, as this  site is not
   generated by a so-called static website generator.

   In case you are curious how the HTMLs are transformed from XMLs, an
   XSL style-sheet  will be  applied on  the source,  with appropriate
   pre- processing stages if necessary.

   The math support is based on MathJax 4.0 (which is currently in its
   beta  stage), mainly  for the  correct  bounding box  trim for  the
   bussproofs extension.   The code highlight is  powered by prism.js,
   which is regular expressions based.

3.  Compatibility

   The HTML5 version should work for all browsers which are capable of
   rendering HTML5  and optionally  CSS3.  The  RsML version  seems to
   work fine  on the  latest Google  Chrome and  Safari 3.   Note that
   Firefox seems problematic when handling XSLT disable-output-escape,
   and so will  enter quirky mode when rendering.   Saxon and xsltproc
   (libxslt) can be used for applying style-sheet.
